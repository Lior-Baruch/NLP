## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Each directory (HW1, HW2, HW3, HW4) contains a standalone assignment. For each assignment, install the necessary Python packages as specified in the respective README files.
3. Follow the instructions in each README file to run the Jupyter notebooks.

## Assignment Overview

Below is a brief overview of each assignment. For more detailed information, please refer to the README file within each assignment's directory.

### HW1: Language Model Creation and Testing from Tweet Data

This assignment involves the construction and evaluation of language models using a dataset composed of tweets in multiple languages. The goal is to predict the next character in a sequence, laying the foundation for many NLP tasks such as text generation, auto-completion, and language identification. [Read More](./HW1/README.md)

### HW2: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

This assignment focuses on developing a POS tagger using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The goal is to predict the POS tag for each word in a given sentence. The performance of the model is quantified using the accuracy metric. [Read More](./HW2/README.md)

### HW3: Named Entity Recognition (NER) with PyTorch

This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER), a subtask of information extraction, using a bi-directional LSTM model in PyTorch. The goal is to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories. [Read More](./HW3/README.md)

### HW4: Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding

This assignment involves the development and evaluation of deep learning models for relation classification between two words in a sentence and sentence similarity prediction tasks. Three different models are built and evaluated. [Read More](./HW4/README.md)

## Contributing

Since these are academic assignments, contributions are not currently sought. However, the methods and code used in these assignments can serve as a foundation for other NLP tasks.
